Individual Reflection

This week I've contributed to breaking down our user stories due to them being too big and generic.
I've also helped build the domain model and the "model" part of our design model. 
What I want to learn is how your are supposed to make MVC work with the android framework. 
The problem with android is that the controller and view are kind of intertwined. 
So I got stuck with finding an efficient way of implementing MVC in android. 
Doing it the standard way is working against the framework something you should never do. 
So I've found the way Google recommends you to implement MVC in android, by using something called ViewModel. 
So I want to learn more about ViewModel by reading their documentation and playing around with it a little.

Another thing is that I was a little impatient while helping the team, especially during the construction of our design model.
So I need to work on not being so hot-headed and also being more patient with ideas from the other people in the group,
trying to see their point of view even if I from the get go disagree with that idea.
